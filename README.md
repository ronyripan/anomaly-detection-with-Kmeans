# anomaly-detection-with-Kmeans

This Project investigates anomaly detection in healthcare domain to effectively predict heart disease using unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm. Our proposed model first evaluates an optimal value of k using the Silhouette method. Next, it intends to locate anomalies which are far from a certain threshold distance with respect to their clusters. Then, we employ boxplot method and the scatter plot to test the exactness of anomalies detected in our model. Finally, the five most popular classification techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR) are applied to build the resultant prediction model. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is justified using a benchmark dataset of "heart disease".
